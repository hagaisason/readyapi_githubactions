      Predefined indicator for the application that is calling the OEM.IL.

      Needs to correspond to an entry in the OEM.IL internal list of valid
      client applications. Please ask OEM.IL Support for oemil-client-app
        - single application: \<PlanningIT short name>
        - platform application: \<platform short name>_\<PlanningIT short name>
      The security gateway will extract the client-application from the token
      and add this header to the request by using that value. If both is
      present, a application value in the token and this http header, then the
      http header will override the token's application value, i.e. an existing
      "oemil-client-app" header will always be looped through to the API
      implementation.

      The brand value of the OEM manufacturer to which the OEM.IL client belongs
      to. Expected to be a valid value as specified in the code list CL00441.

      If the client's brand is already part of the security token, that he
      brings, then this header is allowed to be omitted from the request. The
      security gateway will extract the brand from the token and add this header

      The host and base path of the endpoints do not change and the sourcing
